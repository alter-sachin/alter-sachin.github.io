title: The start of tinkering
---

This is supposed to be the start of new days that will herald into knowing alot more about the world around me. It is quite extraordinary that i do not need a content management system in the usual sense and i can still serve a static website scooped with my ingenious ideas that may just help change the world for the better like jekyll has because before this i used wordpress and it was slow and shallow.
I can ramble on but yea lets start doing stuff mate

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
