title: The start of tinkering
---

ThiS' supposed to be the start of new days that will herald into knowing alot more about the world around me. It is quite extraordinary that i do not need a content management system in the usual sense and i can still serve a static website scooped with my ingenious ideas that may just help change the world for the better like jekyll has because before this i used wordpress and it was slow and shallow.
I can ramble on but yea lets start doing stuff mate
