Now that i have smoked the last cigarrete of my life with the smoke pouring down my throat,mixing succeedingly into the blood that flows through my veins, i have to conclude that my quitting act has surely transpired from this moment onwards
I shall let the thought of wanting a smoke seep into my head and let it go away. Considerably so , previous attempts have not been questioned or rejected the thoughts coming into my head but actually acted on the whims of my hideous thoughts.
Such decisions are within my conscious control and i would want to take this up as a challenge to move onto a more disciplined style of living where my vices are not just stared at but pruned and demolished.

Learning from the past

I clearly remember rationalizing how eventually i will stop smoking , only that i needed it in the moment. Some planned last puffs have considerably been full of irreducible dissatisfaction, of not feeling memorable.
Now by the assets of critical thinking I must disintegrate this particular vice and convinve in arguments and statements these unconscious , unthinking acts of self affliction. Not direct but passive historic self affliction.
A cigarrete for one , does not do any good to a persons mind. Nicotine existing in one's body is akin to expensive furniture in one's own room, brought in perhaps thinking it improves the aesthetic or purely functional aspect of ones room but a less expensive alternative would serve the same purpose.
The cocnept and act of puffing in smoke just to get a break from usual day to dat activities is a reminder and instigator of a troubled, indisciplined mind fighting against its own follies and not really jumping past them. A simple walk could infact serve the same purpose without the physical effects of rotting skin and teeth.
The idea that a cigarette helps concentrate is a pure placebo considering it only feed the unthinking ,unconcious parameters of a minds funciton set.
I would not delve into the physical effects because they are quite obvious and well documented. This industrial cash rich crop that profits the organisations that forsee its supply and demand , even healthcare systems that try treating patients of this malady.
I am going away from this system and the habits it perpetuates
