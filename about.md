I am a dreamer , i guess i am not the only one. Well fuck John lennon and all his one world hysterical junkie phase. Lets face it, the human world is messy and problems that are prevelant are not only rooted in ignorance but also ill knowledge. I am an ex-management consultant , computer science graduate and well alot more. Currently working in the distributed systems domain so expect alot of haphazard or coherent topics that may make you gag or stand up and take notice.
